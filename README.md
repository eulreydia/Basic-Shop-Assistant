# Technical Test – Virtual Assistant for a Clothing Store

## Notes
This assistant is a basic implementation, so many improvements could be made to make it more professional if used in production. Since this is a simple case, I chose to keep it straightforward rather than overcomplicating it.
The assistant was provided as part of the test documentation, so I did not need to create it from scratch and simply used its existing ID.
